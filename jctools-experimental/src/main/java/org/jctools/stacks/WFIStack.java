/**
 * A Wait-Free Intrusive Stack (Last-In, First-Out).
 * <p>
 * This stack has wait-free push, and wait-free bulk pop and bulk replace operations.
 * The single-item pop operation is non-blocking but not wait-free.
 * <p>
 * The stack supports multiple concurrent consumers and multiple concurrent producers.
 * <p>
 * The stack is intrusive, and implementors must extend the {@link Node} class in order to use the stack.
 * These node objects cannot be reused, and must be allocated fresh for every push.
 * <p>
 * The implementation draws inspiration from Dmitry Vyukov's
 * <a href="http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/queues/intrusive-mpsc-node-based-queue">
 * Intrusive MPSC node-based queue</a>, but is oriented as a stack instead of a queue, and supports MPMC.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of node in this stack.
