/**
 * This is a weakened version of the MPSC algorithm as presented <a
 * href="http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/queues/non-intrusive-mpsc-node-based-queue"> on 1024
 * Cores</a> by D. Vyukov. The original has been adapted to Java and it's quirks with regards to memory model and
 * layout:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Use inheritance to ensure no false sharing occurs between producer/consumer node reference fields.
 * <li>As this is an SPSC we have no need for XCHG, an ordered store is enough.
 * </ol>
 * The queue is initialized with a stub node which is set to both the producer and consumer node references. From this
 * point follow the notes on offer/poll.
