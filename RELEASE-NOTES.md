First release!
==========
JCTools offers java.util.Queue implementations for concurrent use. The queues
support a limited subset of the interface focusing on message passing rather
than collection like semantics. In particutlar the queues do not support:
- The iterator() method
- remove()
- contains()

Enjoy!
